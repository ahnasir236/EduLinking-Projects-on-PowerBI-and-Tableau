Prof. Dr. Karim Mohammed Rezaul, Westminster University, UK conducted three days (26 – 28 Apr, 2025) workshop cum training on “International Masterclass in Business Data Analytics”, powered by EduLinking Career and certified by Brit College of Engineering and Technology (BCET), UK. Prof. Dr. Karim delivered comprehensive lectures on Power BI and Tableau. In connection to this workshop, two projects on Power BI and Tableau platforms have been performed. The key features of outputs are described below briefly. 

**First on Power BI:**

A dashboard titled "Sales Analysis on Chocolate Products” has been produced using the CSV data file having columns like Sales Person, Country, Product, Date, Amount, and Boxes Shipped. Its Power Query Editor is a powerful tool for robust data transformation and cleaning, often considered superior for complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes directly within the tool. The dashboards provide a comprehensive analysis of chocolate product sales across six countries (Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, UK, USA) for the year 2022. It aggregates data from transactional records (CSV) to visualize key metrics such as total sales amount, boxes shipped, product performance, and regional contributions.
 
Overall, the dashboards are designed to give a comprehensive view of sales metrics, helping stakeholders identify top-performing regions and products, track monthly sales performance, and understand sales dynamics through visual elements like the waterfall chart. 

**Second on Tableau:**

The Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive "Sales Analysis on Superstore", offering various perspectives on sales performance. It is more intuitive for visual exploration and discovery. Its drag-and-drop interface is highly fluid for creating charts rapidly. It offers extensive customization options for colors, fonts, and chart types, allowing for highly polished and branded dashboards.

This Tableau dashboard for "Sales Analysis on Superstore" effectively highlights key sales trends, profitability, and performance across different categories, segments, and regions. The analysis reveals consistent seasonal sales patterns with year-end peaks. A crucial finding is the presence of unprofitable sub-categories like "Tables," despite their significant sales volume, indicating a need for strategic intervention in pricing or cost management. While sales are relatively balanced across "Technology," "Furniture," and "Office Supplies", granular insights into regional and segment performance provide actionable intelligence for targeted marketing and sales strategies.

Overall, the dashboard empowers stakeholders with a data-driven view to optimize sales, enhance profitability, and make informed business decisions for the Superstore.
